# dev-env-public
public dev environment script for twitter friends

This is the ever evolving script I have been using for years 
to assist in provisioning a new dev environment. 

# Bash Aliases
Bash Aliases have functions and shortcuts used to make 
commands easier to type when troubleshooting. 
Remove them by commenting them out with the '#' at the beginning
of each line or through the functions. 

# Tokens 
To use this script successfully you will need to change the token variable 
in the setup.sh script so that it can pull github repos in the desired locations.


# REPOS 
You can modify the github repos to your own private or public repos by modifying the gh-pull.sh script along with the .list files in the git-repos dir.
